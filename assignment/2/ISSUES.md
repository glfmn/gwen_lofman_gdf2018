# Unity

Because I use Linux, I cannot use the official Unity installer.  Unity supports Ubuntu unofficially, and the Linux team maintains a forum post on the Unity forums with links to download installers for certain releases.  I went to the forum and downloaded the proper installer and installed Unity in my home directory under the hidden folder `.unity`.

# Audacity

Audacity comes pre-installed on Ubuntu.

# Source Tree

Source tree is not available to me, so I did not install it.  I do have GitKraken (another cross-platform git gui) but the only visual interface I use for git is GitHub.  I intend to use comand-line git for all my git needs.

# Gimp

Gimp comes pre-installed on Ubuntu.
